<h1>Context</h1>

<p>We begin every app by instantiating a <b>context</b> directly from the Famo.us rendering Engine. This forms the base of our app and reserves a space for everything to render in the browser. In the code to the right, note how we need to 'require' our Engine dependency before we can call the <b>createContext</b> method on it. Once our context is set, we are ready to start adding some magic with entities.</p>
