<p>Famo.us Mixed Mode is based on an <b>Entity Component System</b>. It may sound complex, but in practice it is really simple. Everything in a Mixed Mode application is connected through an <b>entity</b>.</p> <p>

Entities carry several attributes or <b>components</b> and attach them to the main stage. Check out at the tree like structure pictured to the right. This is the Famo.us <b>scene graph</b> and the basic layout to every Mixed Mode app. Notice how entities are child nodes extending from a single <b>context</b>. Let's take a closer look at the context on the next slide.</p>
