<h1>Positioning Continued</h1>
<p>Upon instantiation, every entity is positioned relative to the center of its parent entity. Since there is no parent entity in our example, the entity will position itself relative to the center of the main context and, in this case, the center of the viewing window.</p> <p>Using the translate method, we move our entity and our surface 150 pixels to the left and 175 pixels up from the center. Notice the negative values provided to the translate method. These values correspond to the X,Y and Z values of our entity's transform component.</p>
