<h1>Positioning</h1>
 
<p>As mentioned previously, every entity has a size, opacity, and transform component. For this lesson, we will focus on the <b>transform</b> component and learn how to use it to position a surface within an application.</p>

<p>In order to modify a component, you must first access it using the <b>getComponent</b> method. Since we are concerned with positioning an entity, we will need to access the <b>translate</b> method on the transform component. Check out the code to the right to see how this is done.</p>
