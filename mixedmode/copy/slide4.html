<h1>Entities</h1>

<p>Entities are the building blocks of a Mixed Mode application. By default, every entity contains three components: <b>size</b>, <b>opacity</b>, and <b>transform</b>. However additional components can be added. By adding and manipulating these components, we can generate animations, display media, and use physics in our application.</p>
<p>To create an entity, simply call the <b>addChild</b> method on the main context or on another entity. After inspecting the code to the right, head over to the next slide to learn about displaying content with a surface component.
