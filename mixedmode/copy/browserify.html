<h1>Getting Started - Mixed Mode - Browserify Seed</h1>

<p><b>Why use the Browserify seed?</b> When using Famo.us, your project will often require a long list of dependencies all declared at the top of your file. In order to manage these dependencies more easily, the Browserify seed includes helpful scripts to run, gather, and bundle all of your dependencies using <a href="#">Browserify.</a></p>

<p><b>Here’s how it works:</b> At the top of your root JavaScript file (check your <i>package.json</i> to find this -by default it’s the <i>index.js</i> file) simply declare your dependencies using the same ‘require’ notation as you would with Node.js.</p>

 <p>When you run an <i>‘npm build’</i> or an <i>‘npm start-dev,’</i> Browserify will look at your root file, gather all the required dependencies and then compile them into a single <i>bundle.js</i> file. Now, instead of linking to multiple scripts in your <i>index.html</i> file, you can include your entire project in a single script tag.</p> 
 <p>The Browserify seed keeps everything tidy in the browser and makes sure your code stays modular behind the scenes! </p>
