
<h1>Positioning Multiple Entities</h1>

In our final example, we move three surfaces towards the top left of the screen. Since our entities on lines 8-10 are all children of the same <i>mainEntity</i>, we can easily move them around as one unit.</p> 

<p>If you take a look at line 37, a single translate method moves all of the entities to left and up by 100 pixels. Then, on lines 40 and 43, individual transforms move the green and red surfaces relative to the <i>mainEntity</i>. By linking entities under a single parent, you can gain fine control over the elements in your app and how they interact with each other.</p> 

<p>Well, that concludes our lesson for today. Stay tuned for more lessons to come! In the meantime, you can learn more about the <a href="#browserify"> Browserify Seed here</a>.</p>
