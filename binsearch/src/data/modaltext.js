How do you find out if a specific value is in the list? Instead of goign through the list and checking each value, you can use the clasic <b>Binary Search</b> algorithm.</p><p>The Binary Search algorithm is a way to quickly find values in a sorted list. You do this by finding the index, comparing it to your target value, and then discarding all of the values that are either greater or less than your target. The larger your list the more time you save! Check out the demo to get a better idea of how this works.</div>";
