					<b>Problem solved</b> â€“ <i>Extracts SKU info from the Ecometry database to reduce errors and drastically cut down time spend retyping data</i><br /><br />
					<div id="imggrab"><img src="../images/autora.png" id="bestsellers" alt="Best Sellers" /></div>
					<br /><br /><i>All of the above info was instantly filled out by pasting SKUs into the first column.<br> Previously this would have taken an hour or more to fill out</i><br /><br />
					<div class="skuarticle"><p id ="skumaintext">
					<b>ABOUT:</b> Although these are the least technical worksheets that I built, they are the most helpful. Our Inventory management program, 
					Ecometry is very slow and  does not allow you to copy and paste from several important fields. In order to get around this I sat 
					down with IT and mapped out a regularly scheduled export of the Ecometry database. Each week 2 files are exported to power my "auto worksheets."
					<br /><br />
					<ul id="listed">
					<li><span id="red">SKULIST_DAILY_UPDATED:</span> This daily exported file lists all SKUs in the Ecomety database. I requested this export to speed up the process of 
					building SKUs on the <a href="http://morgantheplant.com/skuexploder">SKU Exploder</a>. I wrote a function that suggests a SKU based on Vendor + Class + first 3 characters
					of the description and then checks it against the database to see if it is available. If the suggested SKU is already taken then it highlights it in red using a conditional format.
					Here are <a href="">the instructions</a> that I wrote up for it.</li><br />
					<li><span id="red">SKULISTturtle:</span> This is a weekly scheduled export that runs every Tuesday. I named it the "turtle" because of its speed and so it doesn't get 
					confused with the SKULISt_DAILY_UPDATED file. Also because it is pretty funny hearing people in the office talk about the "turtle." This file lists
					all SKUs down to COLOR + SIZE and all other relevent SKU info including DESCRIPTION, VENDOR STYLE NUMBER, COST, PRICE, VENDOR COLOR, WAREHOUSE LOCATION, RECEIPT DATE and ON HAND QUANTITY.
					Here are <a href="">the instructions</a> that I wrote up for it. From the SKULISTturtle I was able to build several time saving worksheet 
					templates. Here are a couple of my favorites:</li><br />
					</ul></p></div>
					<div class="skuarticle"><p id ="skumaintext">
					<b>AUTO PULLFORM:</b> This takes a SKU and pulls out relevant data including DESCRIPTION, VENDOR, VENDOR STYLE, and WAREHOUSE LOCATION. This allows for much faster and more 
					accurately documented QC's and photo pulls. Before, grabbing this info was error prone due to the use of use of O's and 0's and
					other similar looking numbers/letters in the location codes. Ecometry does not let you copy and paste this field so it was a 
					lengthy process that was often mistyped.<br /><br />
					

					<b>AUTO REORDER FORM:</b> This form makes reorders painless by pulling in all product info for a given SKU and reformatting it for our buying logs. It also checks to see if 
					your reordered item was previously on markdown. This is especially helpful for vendors with multiple carryover styles 
					from previous seasons.<br /><br />

					<b>AUTO RA FORM:</b> This template extracts all SKU information including warehouse location for quick return authorizations (RTVs). 
					A secondary tab is included that also reformats the info for an easy one-step copy & paste into our buying logs.<br /> <br />

					<b>REORDER WITH SCALES:</b> Since our size scales change slightly with each season this form helps simplify the reordering process. Our scales are broken
					out by percentage based on sales for each category and style. This form looks up the on hand amount for a given SKU, adds it to the desired 
					reorder amount and then breaks it out by the exact percentage listed. Similar to the Auto Reorder Form this sheet also lists all SKU data 
					for an easy copy and paste into our buying logs.<br /><br />
