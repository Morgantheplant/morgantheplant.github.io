Unlike the base 10 decimal system that we normally use, the binary system increases by the power of 2 with each additional digit.</p><p>This visualization represents a <b>BYTE</b> of binary numbers or the traditional number of digits needed by a computer to encode a single character. Each of the 8 digits or <b>BITS</b> is represented by a colorful card. Notice how each card increases by the power of 2 as you move to the left and how the sum of the cards corresponds to a number. In total, a byte can represent 256 values from 0 to 255. Click the 'Start Counter' to see binary counting in action or enter a number to see its binary equivalent!</p></div>";
